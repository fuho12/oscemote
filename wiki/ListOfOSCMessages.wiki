#summary A list of all OSC messages that OSCemote's built-in panels can send

= Introduction =

Here is a list of all the OSC messages that OSCemote's built-in panels can send.

= Buttons =

Buttons are labeled by row A-E and column 1-3.  They send on/off events as int values 0 and 1.

{{{
/button/{row}{col} {value}
}}}

For example, pressing three buttons in the top row one at a time would send:

{{{
/button/A1 1
/button/A1 0
/button/A2 1
/button/A2 0
/button/A3 1
/button/A3 0
}}}

= Sliders =

Sliders are numbered 1-6.  They send float values between 0 and 1.

{{{
/slider/{number} {value}
}}}

For example, slider number 1 might send:

{{{
/slider/1 0.0
/slider/1 0.1
/slider/1 0.2
/slider/1 0.3
}}}

= Segmented Control =

The segmented control at the bottom of the sliders panel sends the label of the selected segment.  The segment has an id number 0 to allow for more in the future.

{{{
/segmented/{id} {value}
}}}

For example, pressing A, then B, then C sends:

{{{
/segmented/0 A
/segmented/0 B
/segmented/0 C
}}}

= Switches =

The switches at the bottom of the sliders panel send on/off events as int values 0 or 1.

{{{
/switch/{id} {value}
}}}

For example, turning the first switch on, then off sends:

{{{
/switch/1 1
/switch/1 0
}}}

= Accelerometer =

When you turn the accelerometer on or off, it sends an event with an int value 1 or 0 indicating on or off.  When turned on, it sends a stream of 3-axis acceleration events with float values measured roughly in Gs (1.0 g = 9.81 meters per second per second = Earth's gravity).

{{{
/accelerometer {enabled}
/acceleration/xyz {x} {y} {z}
}}}

For example, turning it on, shaking the phone and then turning it off again sends:

{{{
/accelerometer 1
/acceleration/xyz 0.109012 -0.763081 -0.635901
/acceleration/xyz 0.199855 -0.763081 -0.763081
/acceleration/xyz 0.436047 -0.872093 -0.872093
/acceleration/xyz 0.181686 -0.890262 -0.363372
/acceleration/xyz -0.508721 -0.65407 0.490552
/acceleration/xyz -0.454215 -0.52689 1.01744
/acceleration/xyz -0.0363372 -0.327035 0.25436
/acceleration/xyz 0.890262 -0.327035 -2.16206
/acceleration/xyz 0.890262 -0.981105 -2.32558
/acceleration/xyz 0.0363372 -1.28997 -1.14462
/accelerometer 0
