#summary A list of all OSC messages that OSCemote's built-in panels can send

= Introduction =

Here is a list of all the OSC messages that OSCemote's built-in panels can send.

= Buttons =

Buttons are labeled by row A-E and column 1-3.  They send on/off events as int values 0 and 1.

{{{
/button/{row}{col} {value}
}}}

For example, pressing three buttons in the top row one at a time would send:

{{{
/button/A1 1
/button/A1 0
/button/A2 1
/button/A2 0
/button/A3 1
/button/A3 0
}}}

= Sliders =

Sliders are numbered 1-6.  They send float values between 0 and 1.

{{{
/slider/{number} {value}
}}}

For example, slider number 1 might send:

{{{
/slider/1 0.0
/slider/1 0.1
/slider/1 0.2
/slider/1 0.3
}}}

= Segmented Control =

The segmented control at the bottom of the sliders panel sends the label of the selected segment.  The segment has an id number 0 to allow for more in the future.

{{{
/segmented/{id} {value}
}}}

For example, pressing A, then B, then C sends:

{{{
/segmented/0 A
/segmented/0 B
/segmented/0 C
}}}
