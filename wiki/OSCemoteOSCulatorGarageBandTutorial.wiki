#summary Mac-only MIDI Example using OSCulator and Garage Band

= Introduction =

In this example, we'll use the shareware program OSCulator to bridge the OSC messages to MIDI which will in turn control Garage Band.  You'll need to download and install [http://www.osculator.net/wiki/Main/Download/ OSCulator] and use [http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/ Garage Band] or any other MIDI aware software package.

 * Make sure you have [http://www.osculator.net/wiki/Main/Download OSCulator version 2.6.1] or later.  Earlier versions won't work with this tutorial.
 * Download and open this OSCulator settings file: http://lux.vu/iphone/oscemote/OSCemoteMIDI.oscd
 * Now open a new Garage Band document (it should have one instrument already). 
 * Now launch OSCemote on your iPhone.
 * Go to the Settings tab in OSCemote and press the Scan button.  This should auto-detect the IP address of your computer and the port that OSCulator is listening on.
 * If you have trouble with this, make sure your computer's System Preferences, Security, Firewall settings will allow OSCulator to receive incoming connections.
 * Now switch to the buttons view in OSCemote and press one.
 * You should hear some awesome music from Garage Band.
